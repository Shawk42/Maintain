This was an attempt at vibration analysis using Python. 
This respostiory contains the analysis, and not Raspberry Pi Code.
The data was gathered with a Raspberry Pi using as MEMs accelermometer and an old gearbox.
Their were inconclusive results due to the relative sizes and data collection techniques.

Further expansion in this area would be using FFT (Fast Foruier Transforms) and a piezoelectric accelerometer.
